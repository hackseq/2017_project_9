TODO list:

1. collapseTree source
  - how does the collapsetree fuction work already
  - how are mouse click selections interpreted/fed to the actual tree-collapsing part of the function?
2. metadata
  - figure out if we need to use any specific data formats/which are most beneficial (i.e. a tibble or data.frame)
  - decide if we want a stylesheet format (like the dummy example), or for the inputs to be provided as character vectors ( i.e. collapse = c("Rank3"), exclude = c("Helianthus", "Entamoebae") )
  - collect lists of tree tips to collapse based on metadata
3. new functionality
  - select nodes to collapse based on tips
  - collapse nodes
  - label collapsed nodes based on shared ranks
4. wish list...
